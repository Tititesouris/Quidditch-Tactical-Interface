# Quidditch Tactical Interface
_By Quentin Brault, player for the Graz Grimms._

Example tactics can be found in the `example` folder.

### How to use
Open interface.html in a modern browser. (Definitely works with Chrome)  
Import a tactic by `scrolling down`, pasting the tactic's data in the `text field` and clicking the `import` button.  
Export a tactic by `scrolling down` and clicking the `export` button. A file containing the tactic's data should be automatically downloaded. If that isn't the case, you can always copy the contents of the `text field` and save it manually.

### Possible operations INCOMPLETE
- Have a player `grab` a ball by `drag and dropping` the ball `onto` the player.
- `Select` a player or ball by `clicking` on it.
- `Move` a player or ball around by `dragging` it. You can also `move the selected` player/ball by `pressing M` and `clicking` on the desired location.
- TODO rest
